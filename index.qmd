plot_data <- data.frame(
  Actual = test_labels,   
  Predicted = predictions 
)

plot_data$index <- seq_along(test_labels)

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = index)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Actual, color = "Actual")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Predicted, color = "Predicted")) +  
  scale_color_manual(name = "Series", values = c(Actual = "blue", Predicted = "red")) + 
  labs(x = "Size", y = "Temperature", title = "Actual vs. Predicted Temperature") + 
  theme_minimal()
